We are aware of the tragic accident that occurred between a school bus and a pedestrian and his dog.    I want to assure you we are looking at remedies to improve the operation at this intersection.    It is quite challenging due to the traffic volumes  two-way streets on both Dartmouth St and Columbus Avenue  limited geometry to allow widening for turn lanes  and pedestrian volumes as well.      We are in the process of retiming the Back Bay traffic signals and this intersection is part of the study.    Our goal is to come up with a signal phasing that will improve pedestrian safety and accommodate vehicles as well  without causing more backups in your neighborhood.    Currently  the traffic signal has concurrent walks for pedestrians (Walks in the same direction of traffic) and it also has turning arrows from Dartmouth SB to Columbus inbound as well as a right turn arrow from Columbus outbound to Dartmouth northbound.  One issue we have observed is pedestrians crossing Columbus Ave on the east side during the turning arrow phases even though the pedestrian signals display Don't Walk.  They see the traffic signal on Columbus Ave turn red and assume they can walk across  especially from south to north where they cannot see the turning arrows.    The benefit of an exclusive only pedestrian phase (all-walk  all-red for cars) is it is the absolute safest condition for pedestrians.  The downside to an exclusive is it adds delays to the overall intersection causing longer vehicular queues  longer cycle lengths (the amount of time for a signal to serve all approaches before starting over)  and even longer pedestrian delays because a pedestrian will have to wait for other phases to happen before finally receiving the exclusive all-walk.  This can lead to pedestrians becoming impatient and jaywalking  putting themselves in harms way.      Our current plan is to add an exclusive pedestrian phase.  Our study shows the north crosswalk across Dartmouth St is best to only operate under this condition due to the amount of left and right turning vehicles from Columbus Avenue to Dartmouth St NB.  This crosswalk will only turn on during the exclusive pedestrian phase and will display Don't Walk at all other times.  All other crosswalks will also be on during the exclusive pedestrian phase but will remain on during the concurrent traffic phases as well.  We will also eliminate the turn arrows on Dartmouth SB and Columbus outbound to Dartmouth NB  since our analysis shows arrows are not warranted and have a limited effect without a dedicated left-turn lane on to store traffic and there is no room to add one.      A hybrid exclusive/concurrent pedestrian operation should improve pedestrian safety but also not increase pedestrian delay too much overall.    I hope I explained our understanding of the situation and our plan that we hope to enact in Spring 2015 (some of the improvements require restriping and we must wait until after the winter).  Before then we will be making some adjustments to yellow/red times and pedestrian times to the way the signal currently operates.,Traffic Signal Repair,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Repair,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Columbus Ave & Dartmouth St  Boston  MA,4.0,1C,2.0,D4,South End,6.0,Ward 4,401.0,,INTERSECTION Columbus Ave & Dartmouth St,,Intersection,3300.0,42.3458,-71.0752,Constituent Call,"(42.3458, -71.0752)"

Closed date : 2015-11-16 15:01:39.9 Case Noted This signal is designed in conformance with Boston Transportation Department Guidelines which specify a system of walk lights in conformance with federal safety standards and widely used through out the country.  Under this system it is possible to provide longer ""Walk"" times and shorter delays to vehicles and pedestrians.  During the green light for vehicles ""Walk"" signals are on for pedestrians crossing parallel to the flow of traffic.  Under this system turning traffic must yield to pedestrians.  Were we use this type of phasing signs are in place directing turning traffic to yield to pedestrians and additional signs are provided to warn pedestrians to watch for turning vehicles.",Traffic Signal Repair,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Repair,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,100 City Hall Plz  Boston  MA  02108,3.0,1B,1.0,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3.0,Ward 3,0306,C,100 City Hall Plz,2108.0,Address,207944.0,42.3595,-71.0588,Employee Generated,"(42.3595, -71.0588)"

Closed date : 2015-12-10 12:59:52.903 Case Noted Thank you for contacting BTD with your concerns regarding the intersection of Centre Street  South Street and Eliot Street.  Currently this intersection functions in flash mode with all approaches turning red when pedestrians need to cross any part of the intersection.  Because of this no vehicle movements are allowed during the red signal.  BTD is however looking to reconfigure this intersection and your suggestion will be given to the planers working on the new design.,Traffic Signal Repair,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Repair,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Centre St & Eliot St  Jamaica Plain  MA,9.0,02,6.0,E13,Jamaica Plain,11.0,Ward 19,1909.0,,INTERSECTION Centre St & Eliot St,,Intersection,2668.0,42.3097,-71.1155,Employee Generated,"(42.3097, -71.1155)"
