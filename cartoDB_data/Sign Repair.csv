The problem is that if we move the signs one house down to make your side of the street correct  it would move the issue to the opposite side of the street. Harold St continues on the opposite side towards MLK Blvd. None of those buildings are on Harold Pk. One solution would be to move the Harold Pk sign to the median/circle.
