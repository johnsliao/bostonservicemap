We are aware of the tragic accident that occurred between a school bus and a pedestrian and his dog.    I want to assure you we are looking at remedies to improve the operation at this intersection.    It is quite challenging due to the traffic volumes  two-way streets on both Dartmouth St and Columbus Avenue  limited geometry to allow widening for turn lanes  and pedestrian volumes as well.      We are in the process of retiming the Back Bay traffic signals and this intersection is part of the study.    Our goal is to come up with a signal phasing that will improve pedestrian safety and accommodate vehicles as well  without causing more backups in your neighborhood.    Currently  the traffic signal has concurrent walks for pedestrians (Walks in the same direction of traffic) and it also has turning arrows from Dartmouth SB to Columbus inbound as well as a right turn arrow from Columbus outbound to Dartmouth northbound.  One issue we have observed is pedestrians crossing Columbus Ave on the east side during the turning arrow phases even though the pedestrian signals display Don't Walk.  They see the traffic signal on Columbus Ave turn red and assume they can walk across  especially from south to north where they cannot see the turning arrows.    The benefit of an exclusive only pedestrian phase (all-walk  all-red for cars) is it is the absolute safest condition for pedestrians.  The downside to an exclusive is it adds delays to the overall intersection causing longer vehicular queues  longer cycle lengths (the amount of time for a signal to serve all approaches before starting over)  and even longer pedestrian delays because a pedestrian will have to wait for other phases to happen before finally receiving the exclusive all-walk.  This can lead to pedestrians becoming impatient and jaywalking  putting themselves in harms way.      Our current plan is to add an exclusive pedestrian phase.  Our study shows the north crosswalk across Dartmouth St is best to only operate under this condition due to the amount of left and right turning vehicles from Columbus Avenue to Dartmouth St NB.  This crosswalk will only turn on during the exclusive pedestrian phase and will display Don't Walk at all other times.  All other crosswalks will also be on during the exclusive pedestrian phase but will remain on during the concurrent traffic phases as well.  We will also eliminate the turn arrows on Dartmouth SB and Columbus outbound to Dartmouth NB  since our analysis shows arrows are not warranted and have a limited effect without a dedicated left-turn lane on to store traffic and there is no room to add one.      A hybrid exclusive/concurrent pedestrian operation should improve pedestrian safety but also not increase pedestrian delay too much overall.    I hope I explained our understanding of the situation and our plan that we hope to enact in Spring 2015 (some of the improvements require restriping and we must wait until after the winter).  Before then we will be making some adjustments to yellow/red times and pedestrian times to the way the signal currently operates.,General Traffic Engineering Request,Transportation - Traffic Division,Traffic Management & Engineering,General Traffic Engineering Request,BTDT_Engineering_New Sign and Pavement Marking Requests,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Columbus Ave & Dartmouth St  Boston  MA,4.0,1C,2.0,D4,South End,6.0,Ward 4,401.0,,INTERSECTION Columbus Ave & Dartmouth St,,Intersection,3300.0,42.3458,-71.0752,Constituent Call,"(42.3458, -71.0752)"

The unsigned speed limit on E Cottage St is 30mph. The study found the average speed to be 20mph with 1% traveling faster than 30mph. The 85th percentile speed  which is used when determining a speed limit  was found to be 24mph. This would mean that if we were able to post a lower speed limit (only the state can right now)  it would be 25mph because that is the speed that most vehicles travel below. The speeds on this street were actually remarkably low for a street of this type. For example  we typically see the average around 22-24mph  4-7% greater than 30mph and an 85th percentile at 28-30mph. Those averages were based on residential side streets  not minor arterials like E Cottage.

Closed date : 2015-07-09 14:43:27.453 Case Noted Dear Ms. Levendis     Thank you for contacting the Boston Transportation Department (BTD) regarding your request to replace concurrent pedestrian crossing with exclusive pedestrian crossings in the Back Bay neighborhood.    Over the years  BTD is developing traffic signal timing and phasing that reduces delays for vehicles  cyclists  and pedestrians.  Part of this strategy is to remove exclusive pedestrian phases and replace with concurrent pedestrian phases where engineering reviews show it is safe to do so.    While an exclusive pedestrian phase provides pedestrians sole access to an intersection without potential conflicts with turning vehicles  exclusive pedestrian phases can also lead to the following negative issues:    1. Pedestrians will often have to wait a long time for an exclusive pedestrian phase.  As a result  many pedestrians will simply choose to ignore the signal and cross if and when a gap in traffic occurs.  2.   An exclusive pedestrian phase may increase the overall cycle length of the intersection  thus increasing delay for all users.  Since converting many Back Bay traffic signals to concurrent pedestrian crossings  BTD has been able to reduce the cycle lengths by 10 seconds each time of day at most locations.    With concurrent signals  pedestrians usually have more crossing opportunities and shorter waits.     BTD's criteria to use exclusive pedestrian phases include:  1 Restricted turning sight distance  2 Intersection geometry dictates that concurrent pedestrian crossings may be confusing or dangerous  3  Intersections defined within ""safety zones"" near elderly housing  schools  playgrounds  health facilities  etc.    4  Vehicle/pedestrian crashes    It should also be noted that BTD received requests to replace exclusive pedestrian phases with concurrent crossings in the Back Bay by the community and pedestrian advocate groups to reduce pedestrian wait times.    BTD recently conducted a signal retiming study of the Back Bay.  As part of the study  BTD conducted an inventory of missing Yield to Peds on Turn Signs at concurrent crossings.  BTD will be installing missing signs over the summer months.    Whether posted or not  it is required by Mass. General Laws for turning vehicles to yield to pedestrians legally in the crosswalk when they have a Walk/Flashing Don't Walk indication.  If you are observing drivers not obeying this law  BTD suggests contacting the Boston Police Department  D4 Station  and request increased enforcement on this issue at specific locations you are encountering this infraction.",General Traffic Engineering Request,Transportation - Traffic Division,Traffic Management & Engineering,General Traffic Engineering Request,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,84 Commonwealth Ave  Boston  MA  02116,4.0,1C,8.0,D4,Back Bay,14.0,Ward 5,506.0,CM,84 Commonwealth Ave,2116.0,Address,41271.0,42.3522,-71.0755,Constituent Call,"(42.3522, -71.0755)"
