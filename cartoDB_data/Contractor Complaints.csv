It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course.

Closed date : 2015-06-10 08:57:33.603 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Water and Sewer Commission has hired a contractor to come back to the Dudley Square area and permanently  repair the temporary trenches left after the installation of new water and sewer mains..    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    This is what you  observed.    The final top course should be done in the next few days.    The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.      Any questions or concerns you may contact the number listed below.

Closed date : 2015-06-12 08:25:51.043 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.      If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day   this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.  In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.    The trench is scheduled to be paved today.

This will be difficult to prove even if we had a permit and the cut was under 3 years old.

It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    What the constituent observed was the patch awaiting final top course.

The City in order to have these types of repaired as fast as possible issues neighborhood permits to the utility companies.    They are required to make sure that they start at 9:30 on arterial and 7am on residential streets.    The permit always leads with one street.    That's why you thought the permit was for a street blocks away.    The real problem was the contractor put down the dates of the neighborhood permit instead of the dates of work.

Closed date : 2015-08-24 09:35:17.877 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      National Grid has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.      If the city were to make National Grid pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day   this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.    In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.

Part of the scope of work is to install new water sewer and sewer drain.    The City acknowledges this is extensive and deep excavation work.    It takes time to make the connections.    That is why the location is plated nightly.    We sited the contractor for having banging plates last week.  We suspended his job for a day and brought him in to review the rules and regulations.

Closed date : 2015-08-28 10:19:03.86 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving.    It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.     The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride.     The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.     Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates.     We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafleting  for upcoming work.    Since this is a patching contract  the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up.     Sometimes  poor weather  plant breakdowns  or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work.    The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise.

Closed date : 2015-08-31 08:45:48.763 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving.    It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.     The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride.     The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.     Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates.     We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafletting  for upcoming work.     Since this is a patching contract  the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up.     Sometimes  poor weather  plant breakdowns  or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work.     The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise.     Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308     The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

Closed date : 2015-09-18 09:20:24.307 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU)  agrees that the workers should have given you a heads up that the emulation used to help the newly paved adhere to the roadway is a material that will stick to the bottom if your shoes if you walked on it.    I am hoping that your dog is OK.     I am disappointed  that they did not tell you a head of time.  In my experience in paving I have seen workers always warn constituents about not walking on the street with the emulation placed before paving is to be done.       I will speak to the Contractor to make sure that all workers if confronted with that situation do the right thing and warn the person.      You can call the number listed below and I can provide you with the City Clerks information if you want to put a claim in.

The proposed improvement plan consists of constructing a neck-down on the NW corner with new pedestrian ramps and installation of a Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacon (RRFB).  The plan is aimed at improving pedestrian safety at this intersection by improving sight lines reducing conflict points  reducing the crossing distance and providing a flashing beacon warning motorists that a pedestrian is in the crosswalk.  There is also a benefit to bicyclists as motorists will have to transition through the intersection and yield to bicycles in the bike lane in order to access the exclusive right turn lane.  These plans are consistent with the Boston Complete Streets and Vision Zero initiatives.    The concept plan was developed during the East Boston Action Plan completed in 2008 and there were several meetings held at the time.  At these meetings  residents in the neighborhood expressed concern about the safety of pedestrians crossing Saratoga St at this intersection.  The plans were presented at a Neighborhood Council meeting held on May 18  2015 at the Orient Heights Yacht Club and  there were over 100 people in attendance a representative from PWD Engineering Division also attend the meeting.  The Council and the Boston Police Department were very much in favor of this plan to improve safety at this intersection.,Contractor Complaints,Public Works Department,Highway Maintenance,Contractor Complaints,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Bennington St & Saratoga St  East Boston  MA,1.0,09,1.0,A7,East Boston,1.0,Ward 1,112.0,,INTERSECTION Bennington St & Saratoga St,,Intersection,1333.0,42.3866,-71.0067,Constituent Call,"(42.3866, -71.0067)"

Closed date : 2015-10-05 08:39:52.867 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving.    It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The utility work previously done on your street was left with a temporary patch.    The City of Boston does not want the permanent asphalt cross section (typically 6.5"" on residential street and 7.5""on main arterials) to be put back after the gravel down to the pipe has been disturbed.    There is a possibility that settlement could occur. Thats why the City waits before performing the cross section repair.  Our permanent patches hardly ever settle and that is the goal that any City or Town would want to happen regarding utility excavation work.    We do have a unit that inspects backfilling and temporary patches (The Construction Inspection Unit CIU) The CIU does stay on top of the contractors and utility companies.  Many of the temporary patches are in good condition.    However  the key is the patch is only 3"".  We need the full cross section put back.    This is what you are seeing being done on your street right now.    Below is the steps taken to do the permanent repair.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 to 7.5"" inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    I hope this explanation clarifies things for you.    If not please don't hesitate to call me.

In addition we are allowing some utility work to be done before the final paving is scheduled.     When completed it will be a major improvement for  the pedestrians  cyclists and motorists who travel these street daily.    We acknowledge the construction is a major inconvenience to the public.     We have police details called in every day. They obviously will help with traffic control and public safety.    You will also notice more jersey barriers and barricades in use to help guide pedestrians and traffic through and around the work zones.    We have asked the contractor to restore all pavement markings within their work zone even if they have not disturbed the markings. This means that all crosswalks/ double yellows/skip lines/ arrow onlys etc will be maintained throughout the project.    All temporary pavement markings will be completed by November 6th    We ask for your patience while this major project takes place.

This will improve the reliability of electrical service in South Boston.    The contractor is McCourt.    The transmission line work requires more plates than usual do to the complications of this type of work.      We told the contractor McCourt though we acknowledge securing a large amount of plates is not easy it has to be done.    They need to berm the plates properly every time they leave the job  this will require them to wedge the plates  pin them  and tac weld problem plates when necessary.    The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) regularly inspects the work and has found for the most part they are in compliance with our rules and regs    We met with them recently and reviewed our procedures especially regarding plates  and we feel that you will have less complaints about loud noise.    The City acknowledges this is a major project and is an inconvenience to the residents of the street and we appreciate your patience and cooperation.

Closed date : 2015-11-14 08:41:20.3 Case Resolved   Dear Constituent        Eversource Electric  is installing new conduit.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      Eversource Electric has to install the electric main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.      If the city were to make Eversource Electric pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.  More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day   this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.      In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.  Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.    The trench was paved yesterday.    Thank you for your patience.

The two attached photos depict the conditions in 2012 just prior to our BWSC improvements.   It appears that your driveway has minimal slope and does not drain.  Mass Ave's grades are higher than your driveway which does not allow your driveway to drain.  We are required by BPWD to install permanent trench repair and restore sidewalks to match existing grades.  We did reduce the amount of puddles  but due to the fact of the extremely flat condition in this area  we could not abate all the puddles.      If you want to discuss this in more detail  please let me know.  I tried calling you twice last week and your answering machine did not allow a message to be left.
