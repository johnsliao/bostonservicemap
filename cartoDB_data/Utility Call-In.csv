Closed date : 2015-12-14 08:47:44.497 Case Resolved     Dear Constituent     All over the City utility companies are currently installing new gas mains  water mains electric mains  etc..    In addition many service connections at the request of homeowners or businesses are also being installed.    Solid dependable utility service is so important to make the City function.    What we take for granted we definitely are affected when a particular utility service is disrupted.    Because of the recent good stretch of weather we have been experiencing we have allowed construction to extend until December 23rd.    Working everyday every available day is critical to make ensure projects are completed by December 23rd..    That is why we allowed them to work yesterday.    They should not have started before 7am  and we will speak to the contractor to make sure they start on time.    The City thanks you for your understanding.    For any questions or concerns  please contact the number listed below  Sincerely     Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works Department  617-635-4951 Office,Utility Call-In,Public Works Department,Highway Maintenance,Utility Call-In,PWDx_Utility Call-In,PWDx,,,1 Torpie St  Mission Hill  MA  02120,9.0,10A,8.0,B2,Mission Hill,14.0,Ward 10,1003.0,R3,1 Torpie St,2120.0,Address,136273.0,42.3331,-71.1027,Constituent Call,"(42.3331, -71.1027)"
