Closed date : 2015-12-11 18:24:58.123 Case Noted I met with the owner of the restaurant today and discussed about the complaint.� He informed me that the HVAC system shuts down at 11:30 pm automatically.� But someone contacted the restaurant on Wednesday night.� The woman was upset because the system was running later than scheduled at 12:30am due to a private party. The restaurant has a license for food and alcohol until 2 am.�   I advised the owner and manager to have their technician come in and check the system to see if it is in compliance with the city noise regulations. He confirmed that he already did that not long ago  but will do it again. � I also requested that he sent a report about the incident and also to send me a copy of the license.   If complaints continue  please get more info about the person or ask that person to contact me.� Thank you.
