A summary of the engineer's findings are as follows:     We have reviewed this location and determined that this problem is caused by the driveway being wider than the curb cut. In extreme circumstances  we have on occasion posted driveway signs  however  if we were to post them here we would inadvertently be encouraging vehicles to drive over the sidewalk to access the driveway. When a driveway is widened  the curb cut should also be altered. Please contact the Public Works Public Improvements Commission to explore the process through which a resident can have their driveway apron widened. 617-635-4960.,Missing Sign,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Missing Sign,BTDT_Engineering_New Sign and Pavement Marking Requests,BTDT,,,17 Gaston St  Dorchester  MA  02121,9.0,10B,7.0,B2,Roxbury,13.0,Ward 12,1202.0,CD,17 Gaston St,2121.0,Address,62995.0,42.3135,-71.082,Self Service,"(42.3135, -71.082)"

Closed date : 2015-05-22 08:46:33.29 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:    The crosswalk in question did not meet ADA specifications.      On all sanctioned crosswalks a ramp is required on either side.      In this case there was edgestone on one side of the crosswalk not allowing a person in a wheel chair to cross  making it illegal.    In addition the engineer states that the school buses let the students off right at this crosswalk.      That is why PWD did not restore after the paving took place.    Recommend that you contact BTD engineering regarding your request.
