Closed date : 2015-11-06 08:56:23.76 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Department Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the sidewalk left in asphalt as belonging to National Grid.    Sidewalks are required to be restored within 60 days.    This particular work was done within the last 3 weeks.    Since the Public Works has a moratorium on all concrete pour work beginning in late November  this sidewalk may not be returned to concrete until the Spring    Since there was a moratorium on concrete and brick repair work until April 15th  the patch had to remain in asphalt.      We did request National Grid try to restore the sidewalk by November 15th.    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.
