Utility Companies have 60 days to permanently restore the sidewalk.  Since the work was done in the fall  and we do not allow any permanent restoration work between December 1st and April 1st  the bricks will be restored in the Spring.      The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.    The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work caused.

Closed date : 2015-05-30 08:56:52.027 Case Resolved Mark Cardarelli called the constituent and explained that the property owners were repairing their cellar that jets out underneath the sidewalk.  The city refers to them as area ways.  The property owners are not only responsible for the area way but the sidewalk above the area way.      This particular area way was so unsafe that the area way and sidewalks needed to be done over.      This is a very expensive and logistically difficult repair.  That is why it is taking so long.      The city apologizes for the inconvenience.

Emergency work must be performed no matter what time of day or night in the interest of public safety and the protection of private property.    The hot top patch you see is temporary.    The City requires permittees to restore the sidewalk to its original condition within 60 days of completion of the work.     National Grid has been notified by the CIU of the 60 day requirement    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    If within the 60 day interim period the inspector finds that the asphalt patch is uneven  and not smooth and level  the permittee will be required to re-do the asphalt until the permanent repair is scheduled.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.    Any questions or concerns about this location you may contact the number listed below.

Closed date : 2015-05-28 09:35:39.513 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector investigated and determined the following:    Eversource Electric in early April installed a service into 51 Brookline Ave.      Late last Fall National Grid also installed a service at this location.    Permittees have 60 days to restore the sidewalk after the completion of their work.    In addition since no concrete work could be done between Nov 15 and April 15th  all work done in that time period will be restored within 60 days of the opening of the  2015 construction season (April 15th)    Both utilities have been notified to restore the sidewalks to concrete by June 15th.    The CIU has added the locations to its data base that tracks  utility sidewalk work needing permanent restoration.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the work.     The City apologizes for the inconvenience for this necessary work.     Any questions or concerns you make contact the number listed below.

Permitees have 60 days to restore the sidewalk after placing the temporary asphalt patch.    The CIU inspector tells me the work is only a couple of weeks old.    We have requested that National Grid restore the sidewalk sooner than later within the 60 day period.    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.

The City yards in East Boston are not equipped to repair sidewalks permanently  they only try to make them safe.  As the Engineer in charge of sidewalks and with East Boston as my home town  I make it a point to do as much work as possible.  My sidewalk crew is NOT in East Boston.  We have NOT been there and will not be there for a few months.    As it is now  we have 3400 requests to repair sidewalks in the City of Boston.  The turn around time is 19 months.  So for a request to come in 6 months ago prior to one of the worse winters we have ever had  and not to be immediately repaired should be understood and expected.    When we get to East Boston  I will do my best to take care of this situation.  If you have any other questions or concerns  please feel free to call me.

Closed date : 2015-07-18 07:50:01.547 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Department Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the sidewalk left in asphalt as belonging to BWSC.    The City requires permittees to restore the sidewalk to its original condition within 60 days of completion of the work.      BWSC has been notified by the CIU of the 60 day requirement    We have ordered that bricks be removed to a safe location until the repairs are made.    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    If the inspector finds that the asphalt patch is uneven  and not smooth and level the permittees will be required to re-do the asphalt until the permanent repair is scheduled.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.    Any questions or concerns about this location you may contact the number listed below.

He also placed barricades in front of the fence.    The problem is because Middle St is so narrow if we required a temporary path of travel into Middle St to walk around the fence it would affect parking and emergency vehicles.

Closed date : 2015-08-21 13:49:04.41 Case Noted It is not uncommon to make a pedestrian ramp in this fashion.  The ramp is easily accessible from Chestnut Ave.  It was impossible to make a compliant pedestrian ramp that was more on Chestnut Square as it would have undermined the existing wall.    When the street is paved  the edgestone reveal will not be as much as it is now.

Closed date : 2015-11-04 09:01:17.533 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Department Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the sidewalk left in asphalt as belonging to National Grid.    Sidewalks are required to be restored within 60 days.    This work was done in October    Since the Public Works has a moratorium on all concrete pour work beginning in late November  this sidewalk may not be returned to concrete until the Spring    We did request National Grid try to restore the sidewalk by November 15th.    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors     If at anytime the asphalt patch becomes unacceptable National Grid will be required to make repairs.  This includes the Winter period if need be.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.

Sidewalks are required to be restored within 60 days.

Closed date : 2015-11-09 08:07:41.11 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Department Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the sidewalk left in asphalt as belonging to Waveguide.    Sidewalks are required to be restored within 60 days.    This particular work was done within the last 3 weeks.    Since the Public Works has a moratorium on all permanent sidewalk repair work beginning in late November  this sidewalk may not be returned to brick until the Spring    The CIU Inspector had already informed Waveguide that the temporary asphalt patch was unacceptable.   They have been told they have to repair the patch by this Friday or we will suspend there ability to receive permits.    We are also working with them to have the brick restored before November 30th.    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.

Closed date : 2015-11-16 08:44:13.067 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Mark Cardarelli contacted Eversource Electric and informed Eversource that the vault at 88 St Stephens needed repairs ASAP.       Eversource  stated that these are not easy repairs to make.    The covers have to be fabricated and the work itself is tedious.      Eversource  estimates that it is a minimum of 6 weeks and usually much longer before a  vault can be repaired    Eversource has been asked to at least make the area around the vault safe for pedestrian travels until a permanent repair can be made.    The CIU has added the location to its data base that tracks unacceptable utility work.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the work.     The  approaching Winter Moratorium  may push the work until next spring.

Since the Public Works has a moratorium on all concrete pour work beginning in late November  this sidewalk may not be returned to concrete until the Spring    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.     If at anytime the asphalt patch becomes unacceptable Caruso Corporation will be required to make repairs.  This includes the Winter period if need be.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.

B Rotondi.    Since the Public Works has a moratorium on all concrete pour work beginning in late November  this sidewalk may not be returned to concrete until the Spring.    The location has been entered into the CIU data base that tracks repairs to be made by utility companies or private contractors.     If at anytime the asphalt patch becomes unacceptable E.B Rotondi will be required to make repairs.  This includes the Winter period if need be.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the repair.
