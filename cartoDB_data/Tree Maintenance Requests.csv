We talked with Verizon's Stephanie Lee today and she stressed that Verizon won't trim as their wires will stand up to the vegetation.  Comcast doesn't do this.  Trimming years of overgrowth that has spilled onto fire escapes & neighboring buildings is the responsibility of the condo association or homeowners; they should hire a landscaping outfit.
