Boston Transportation Department works with the Boston Police Department to enforce traffic laws and educate all users of the city's roads. Through our Boston Bikes program  we work with hundreds of residents each year  teaching them the rules of the road  how to ride safely  and how to share space respectfully. We also offer helmets at low cost to all riders and work with other agencies and universities to distribute helmets each year. Many people on bikes carry insurance via their auto insurance policies. Through the new Vision Zero initiative  we are working to create a culture of safety on our streets and expect to do more outreach and enforcement.,Boston Bikes: Bikes - General; Enforcement,Transportation - Traffic Division,Boston Bikes,Bicycle Issues,BTDT_BostonBikes,BTDT,,,1 City Hall Plz  Boston  MA  02108,3.0,1B,1.0,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3.0,03,0306,E,1 City Hall Plz,2108.0,Address,32856.0,42.3604,-71.0583,Constituent Call,"(42.3604, -71.0583)"
