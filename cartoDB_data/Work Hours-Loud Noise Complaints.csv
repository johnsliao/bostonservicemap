Closed date : 2015-08-17 09:56:18.333 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     National Grid is installing a new main on your street. The city highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.     The city acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents.    However in the long run the construction is well worth it.     Having a street dug up for emergency repairs soon after paving is frustrating for all. With the new gas main installed  the city can feel extremely comfortable that no embarrassing street cuts will happen if it determines to pave your street in the future.     The contractor does have a permit to work on Saturday's at 7am.  It is 9:30-3:30 Monday-Friday.  We instructed the contractor to not start work until 8:30am on Saturday's.

National Grid stated to the City that their main needed to  be replaced.    The work proved very very difficult and took much longer than anticipated.    Obviously it has set the project back  but we didn't want to have gas leaks repairs after we paved the street.    We want the reconstruction  project to be completed by November 15th  so we allowed National Grid to work selected nights to speed up completion.    The work is now done. There will be no more night work.     Mario Susi will start back up next week.    On behalf of the City I apologize for the inconvenience the new gas main work caused.

Closed date : 2015-10-01 08:04:52.52 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     As you are aware of the Public Works Department is resurfacing A St from West Broadway to Congress St.    The street was in desperate need of resurfacing.      The contractor we used owns an asphalt plant and all equipment needed to resurface.      Instead of relying on subcontractors and taking up to a month to resurface  we decided it was better to pave the  street as fast as possible.    This is a better alternative than inconveniencing the residents of A St for up to a month.    The jack hammering you heard was for the utilities to adjust their manholes.   We try to minimize loud noise after 11pm.      I spoke to the engineer today who told me the paving will be complete by this afternoon.    On behalf of the City we thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

Closed date : 2015-12-03 08:29:27.823 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     National Grid is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      Normal construction is allowed to start at 7am.    This is typical throughout Massachusetts.    We will talk to Feeney about trying not to jackhammer first thing in the morning  but in some cases they may have to.    The good news is that National Grid has made a commitment to the neighborhood to replace an old gas main prone to leaks.

Closed date : 2015-12-14 08:48:00.39 Case Resolved     Dear Constituent     All over the City utility companies are currently installing new gas mains  water mains electric mains  etc..    In addition many service connections at the request of homeowners or businesses are also being installed.    Solid dependable utility service is so important to make the City function.    What we take for granted we definitely are affected when a particular utility service is disrupted.    Because of the recent good stretch of weather we have been experiencing we have allowed construction to extend until December 23rd.    Working everyday every available day is critical to make ensure projects are completed by December 23rd..    That is why we allowed them to work yesterday.    They should not have started before 7am  and we will speak to the contractor to make sure they start on time.    The City thanks you for your understanding.
