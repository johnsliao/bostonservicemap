On all sanctioned crosswalks a ramp is required on either side.      In this case there was edgestone on one side of the crosswalk not allowing a person in a wheel chair to cross  making it illegal.    In addition the engineer states that the school buses let the students off right at this crosswalk.      That is why PWD did not restore after the paving took place.    Recommend that you contact BTD engineering regarding your request.

Closed date : 2015-10-01 09:04:22.47 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     As you are aware of the Public Works Department is resurfacing A St from West Broadway to Congress St.    The street was in desperate need of resurfacing.    The contractor we used owns an asphalt plant and all equipment needed to resurface.    Instead of relying on subcontractors and taking up to a month to resurface  we decided it was better to pave the street as fast as possible.    This is a better alternative than inconveniencing the residents of A St for up to a month.    The jack hammering you heard was for the utilities to adjust their manholes. We try to minimize loud noise after 11pm.    I spoke to the engineer today who told me the paving will be complete by this afternoon.    On behalf of the City we thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

This is a very difficult location to work in.    They have put in beams to try to mitigate the noise.   We are going to make them put a membrane around the beam to further mitigate the noise.    In addition they will be digging out the area before and after the plate and placing asphalt so that they entire area is on the same grade.

The sidewalk and driveway entrance were in deplorable condition due to teachers cars driving over the sidewalk.  The PWD repaired the sidewalk.  The Custodian asked for us to widen the driveway entrance and I personally told him that a permit was required.  The PWD does not widen driveway entrances unless there is a permit pulled.  If the school wanted the driveway entrance widened  then the administrative offices should have pulled a permit or spoke with me regarding this.  BUT to say that our repairing the sidewalk caused teachers to drive over the sidewalk is false.  We repaired the sidewalk that was damaged and made it safe for children to walk to school.
