Closed date : 2015-07-24 08:55:48.253 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving.    It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.    The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt that provides the smooth ride.    What the constituent observed was the patch awaiting final top course.     The patch will be topped this Saturday.    The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

Closed date : 2015-10-27 10:10:49.25 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     Eversource  Gas is installing a new gas main.  The city encourages this type of capital upgrade work.  It will eliminate future emergency repairs.      Eversource Gas has to install the gas main first.  Once the main has been installed  then all service connections can be made.      If the city were to make Eversource Gas pave to grade each day's trench work   it would cause multiple seams along the trench.    More importantly  every service connection needs to be cut into the trench.  If we were to pave the trench every day   this would result in 2 by 2 patches inside the trench area  resulting in a very poor final product.      In order to have the best final paving  the city allows the utility company to leave the trench down low until all service connections are made and then pave the trench all at once  resulting in a smooth  level final trench repair.      Service laterals are topped within 24 hours of excavation.       What the constituent is observing is the trench left down low in preparation for one continuous final paving operation.
