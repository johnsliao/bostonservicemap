If vehicles are not stopping at the stop sign  that is an issue for the Boston Police to address and we suggest you contact your local precinct. Given that Farrington Ave is a one way road leading to Linden  those crossing only need to look in one direction and cross one travel lane. Crosswalks are marked when special emphasis is required (crossing multiple lanes  high speed traffic  etc.). Cars already have to stop at the stop sign before the crossing area and yielding to pedestrians is a state law whether or not there is a painted crosswalk present. If this issue remains after BPD steps up stop sign enforcement  please get back in touch with us and we can reexamine the issue.

We are aware of the tragic accident that occurred between a school bus and a pedestrian and his dog.    I want to assure you we are looking at remedies to improve the operation at this intersection.    It is quite challenging due to the traffic volumes  two-way streets on both Dartmouth St and Columbus Avenue  limited geometry to allow widening for turn lanes  and pedestrian volumes as well.      We are in the process of retiming the Back Bay traffic signals and this intersection is part of the study.    Our goal is to come up with a signal phasing that will improve pedestrian safety and accommodate vehicles as well  without causing more backups in your neighborhood.    Currently  the traffic signal has concurrent walks for pedestrians (Walks in the same direction of traffic) and it also has turning arrows from Dartmouth SB to Columbus inbound as well as a right turn arrow from Columbus outbound to Dartmouth northbound.  One issue we have observed is pedestrians crossing Columbus Ave on the east side during the turning arrow phases even though the pedestrian signals display Don't Walk.  They see the traffic signal on Columbus Ave turn red and assume they can walk across  especially from south to north where they cannot see the turning arrows.    The benefit of an exclusive only pedestrian phase (all-walk  all-red for cars) is it is the absolute safest condition for pedestrians.  The downside to an exclusive is it adds delays to the overall intersection causing longer vehicular queues  longer cycle lengths (the amount of time for a signal to serve all approaches before starting over)  and even longer pedestrian delays because a pedestrian will have to wait for other phases to happen before finally receiving the exclusive all-walk.  This can lead to pedestrians becoming impatient and jaywalking  putting themselves in harms way.      Our current plan is to add an exclusive pedestrian phase.  Our study shows the north crosswalk across Dartmouth St is best to only operate under this condition due to the amount of left and right turning vehicles from Columbus Avenue to Dartmouth St NB.  This crosswalk will only turn on during the exclusive pedestrian phase and will display Don't Walk at all other times.  All other crosswalks will also be on during the exclusive pedestrian phase but will remain on during the concurrent traffic phases as well.  We will also eliminate the turn arrows on Dartmouth SB and Columbus outbound to Dartmouth NB  since our analysis shows arrows are not warranted and have a limited effect without a dedicated left-turn lane on to store traffic and there is no room to add one.      A hybrid exclusive/concurrent pedestrian operation should improve pedestrian safety but also not increase pedestrian delay too much overall.

Furthermore  both Custer and Goldsmith are one ways with Goldsmith already having a Stop Sign. With traffic on Goldsmith already stopping  there is no reason for those on Custer to stop as well. Sight lines were fair due to the presence of a curb ramp on the left of the Custer approach  which acts as a corner restriction. If a car is waiting on Goldsmith at the stop sign  they can see vehicles approaching the intersection on Custer. Additionally  with traffic having to stop at end of Custer at Arborway only 100ft further down  adding a stop sign here could lead to higher speeds in between segments  which would be an unintended consequence.

Stop signs are not installed for speed control. To warrant a stop sign  the intersection must meet a certain threshold of vehicles per hour  vehicular collisions within a 12-month period  and sight distance. With this being a T-intersection and Wellington Hill being a one-way downhill   the operations of the intersection are rather straightforward in regard to assigning the right of way (the purpose of a stop sign). Often residents feel that a stop sign can solve speeding issues  however  many studies have shown that stop signs are not an effective measure for controlling or reducing  midblock speeds. In fact  the overuse of stop signs may cause drivers to carelessly stop at the stop signs that are installed. In stop sign observance studies approximately half of all motorists came to a rolling stop and 25 percent did not stop at all. Stop signs can give pedestrians a false sense of safety if it is assumed that all vehicles will come to a complete stop at the proper location. A study also showed that placing stop signs along a street may actually increase the peak speed of vehicles  because motorists tend to increase their speed between stop signs to regain the time spent at the stop signs. As this is a relatively compact neighborhood with minimal cut through traffic and mostly local residents using the roadway (aside from school operations)  making neighbors aware of the perceived speeding problem will usually lead to lower speeds.,New Sign  Crosswalk or Pavement Marking,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,New Sign  Crosswalk or Pavement Marking,BTDT_Engineering_New Sign and Pavement Marking Requests,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Wellington Hill St & Ormond St  Mattapan  MA,8.0,07,4.0,B3,Greater Mattapan,9.0,Ward 14,1408.0,,INTERSECTION Wellington Hill St & Ormond St,,Intersection,6209.0,42.2798,-71.0936,Constituent Call,"(42.2798, -71.0936)"

Ashmont St is a main road and as such  stop sign installation would not be appropriate at a side street.

Also on the street is commercial parking and that too would need to be worked.

Currently BTD does not stripe individual parking spaces. This is partly because it becomes a maintenance issue and partly because it actually reduces the number of available spaces. In ""natural"" parking  a car takes up approximately 16-17 feet. When we mark individual spaces (or layout meters)  we are required to provide 20-22 feet per vehicle because the spaces need to accommodate every vehicle length. So to answer your question  while there may be some annoying gaps between cars occasionally  there would be even fewer spaces if they were painted.",New Sign  Crosswalk or Pavement Marking,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,New Sign  Crosswalk or Pavement Marking,BTDT_Engineering_New Sign and Pavement Marking Requests,BTDT,,,95 Baldwin St  Charlestown  MA  02129,3.0,1A,1.0,A15,Charlestown,2.0,Ward 2,207.0,R1,95 Baldwin St,2129.0,Address,7949.0,42.383,-71.0694,Constituent Call,"(42.383, -71.0694)"

Responding to each of your requests: 1) Stop signs are ineffective at speed control and can only be installed for vehicular considerations per federal guidelines (sight distance  near equal volumes on approaches  3-5 crashes in 12 month period). 2) Only the Commonwealth of Massachusetts can change the speed limit and it has to be done through an act of the legislature. There is a statewide 30mph speed limit in thickly settled areas that all cities and towns must adhere to. We do have a number of warning signs posted already for speed control. 3) As different divisions have different functions  you will need to resubmit your request for private way signs. The only signs we can post are street name signs with ""pvt way"" on them.

The presence of parked vehicles on either side of the street aide a pedestrian by narrowing the crossing distance and allowing them to be in a better position to be seen by an approaching vehicle. As this is the end of Chase St vehicles are stopping already before turning onto E Cottage. Marking a high visibility crosswalk here would have a negligible effect on safety.

National Grid had to move its main in order for the project to continue.    According to National Grid they had to keep working until they could close the main. That�s why they worked late.    The Eversource contractor knows his hours are 7am to 5pm and unless there is an emergency those are the hours he should work.    If they do have to work over they must notify the CIU    The City thanks you for your patience    For any questions or concerns  please contact the number listed below.

BTD and BPS Transportation conducted a site visit to this location a few weeks ago to see if it was feasible for a crosswalk installation. Based on federal guidelines ( site distance  roadway geometry and parking constraints) a crosswalk cannot be installed at the requested location.      BTD and BPS have developed a comprehensive safe route plan to improve the pick up and drop off procedures for parents for this school which includes new pick up/drop off spaces on Olney St and directing pedestrians to school grounds. BPS Transportation will be notifying the school of the new operating procedures via written notification.      The existing school warning signs have been updated as a new traffic light signal is scheduled to be constructed at the intersection of Geneva and Olney St in the near future.

Posting 30mph (the current speed limit set by MA state law) would actually increase the speeds on this street since most motorists are driving much slower than the speed limit.
