We have had problems with people putting in zones they were not parked in  which then creates a false positive on the hand-helds  but this is the first complaint I've seen on tickets issued when a driver paid.  Perhaps somebody from OPC can reach out to her and figure out if maybe her plate info is input incorrectly in the app or something else is happening once they have her plate number to look up the transaction records.  -Kris,Other: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,INFO_General Comments Complaints Compliments,INFO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"

We are working with the Public Works Department as well as the Boston Police Department and other first responding agencies that may have any helpful input pertaining to this matter. This is not an easy task to quickly decide if the One Ways will work during the off season as they did during the winter. As I am sure you understand  this is a very delicate decision  which has a lot of moving parts that deserves a lot of attention.     The City of Boston appreciates your feedback and your interest in this matter as well. As a resident  your input is a vital piece of information which helps with the decision.     The City of Boston is doing everything they can to accommodate the needs/wants of the residents as well as its visitors traveling through our streets safely and efficiently.    We are confident that a decision will be made on this issue relatively soon.    If you have any questions  please do not hesitate to contact me.

I met with Mr. Ostiguy again this morning to hear from his children. During the course of our investigation  there were students who mistreated the Ostiguy children. We have addressed those students. It also came to light that the children continue to leave their assigned seats and the issues tend to arise after they move to the back of the bus. In response to this  Dr. Sealy and I have assigned every student a new seat on the bus and have instructed the driver to specifically report any student who moves from their assigned seat.  I've also addressed personally every student on the bus.  I'm happy to talk more if you need addition information. THanks and have a great weekend.

He wants to be added to his mother's lease which is fine but she is currently in a Nursing Home and he refuses for us to speak to her. She is the only one on the lease and the daughter has all legal rights not Mr. William.  Management did schedule a meeting with him (two weeks) and he cancelled but stated that he would call to reschedule. As of today he had not called.  I asked him to reschedule his meeting with management and in order for us to move forward we need to speak to Norma.  He has my contact number for further questions.

We are working with the Public Works Department as well as the Boston Police Department and other first responding agencies that may have any helpful input pertaining to this matter. This is not an easy task to quickly decide if the One Ways will work during the off season as they did during the winter. As I am sure you understand  this is a very delicate decision  which has a lot of moving parts that deserves a lot of attention.     The City of Boston appreciates your feedback and your interest in this matter as well. As a resident  your input is a vital piece of information which helps with the decision.     The City of Boston is doing everything they can to accommodate the needs/wants of the residents as well as its visitors traveling through our streets safely and efficiently.    We are confident that a decision will be made on this issue relatively soon.    If you have any questions  please do not hesitate to contact me.

We are working with the Public Works Department as well as the Boston Police Department and other first responding agencies that may have any helpful input pertaining to this matter. This is not an easy task to quickly decide if the One Ways will work during the off season as they did during the winter. As I am sure you understand  this is a very delicate decision  which has a lot of moving parts that deserves a lot of attention.     The City of Boston appreciates your feedback and your interest in this matter as well. As a resident  your input is a vital piece of information which helps with the decision.     The City of Boston is doing everything they can to accommodate the needs/wants of the residents as well as its visitors traveling through our streets safely and efficiently.    We are confident that a decision will be made on this issue relatively soon.    If you have any questions  please do not hesitate to contact me.

The Boston Public Library (BPL) does require contact information to establish an account for every library user.  This personal information remains confidential and can only be viewed online by the patron when that patron has logged into the BPL online catalog by entering the patron's library card number and personally selected 4-digit PIN.  The BPL encourages patrons to keep their library card number and PIN private  just as one would a credit or debit card.  The personal information is only able to be displayed when a patron is logged in to the online catalog; it is not stored by the third party vendor who hosts the BPL catalog.  The library card number and PIN remain securely stored on the BPL's server.  Since 2011  the BPL has contacted with Bibliocommons  Inc. for purposes of hosting the BPL's catalog.  Bibliocommons was selected because it addressed the most frequently patron-suggested improvements to the online catalog.  Namely  Bibliocommons provides:   *         Relevancy ranking of search results  *         Reading recommendations  *         The ability to create a user name in lieu of entering the 14-digit library barcode  *         Social features like ratings  reviews  and sharing to services like Facebook and Twitter  *         The option to create reading history lists automatically as items are returned  Now  as always  the BPL does not store a patron's circulation history.  Once a borrowing transaction is complete  the record of that transaction is deleted from the BPL server.  The only things stored beyond that  in the catalog  are lists a patron chooses to make for himself or information a patron chooses to share with others  like reviews or ratings.  The use of the social features are entirely optional.  If a patron never rates or reviews a title  none of the patron's activities will ever be shared with others.  Also  please note  if a patron does not like the BPL's main catalog  an alternate catalog is offered from the ""Alternate Catalog"" link in the BPL Collections menu on http://bpl.org.  If you have questions or require any additional information  please let me know.  Thank you.  _____________________________________ Deborah A.

I did not hang flyers throughout the building because I considered the name of the play to be controversial. However  I did consider the issues covered in this play to be relevant and introduced in a way that it may have a positive affect on some our students.  I believe that the person who called the hotline did not read the message below or look at the actual flyer.  If you have any questions  contact me at any time.   Than you.    MP Family   Our students have been invited to attend an MIT showing of ""Slut The Play"". This is a wonderful opportunity to open up a conversation with our students about a topic that is shaming and transformative in their lives. In addition they will experience MIT and the campus at large.  I hope to empower students with knowledge and conversation around the topic and bring light to an issue that is prevalent among many school communities.   Please send students you select to the Student Center to pick up a Permission Slip.   Also  the Event is  free...there is no cost for our students or chaperons.

The BPRD relies heavily on business/homeowners to help water the trees and to inform the BPRD if the trees health is declining after the first two years. The contractor who planted the tree is responsible for watering the trees as well during the growing season for the first two years. All new trees are inspected every summer during the warranty period to make sure they are alive and healthy. If they are found to be dead they will be placed on the warranty replacement list for the contractor to replace. The department is also currently working on a new handout to give to residents regarding new trees. There is a door knocker that is currently being used when a site is inspected for a new tree to be planted.,PARKS: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,PARK_Tree Maintenance Request,PARK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"

Closed date : 2015-05-29 08:58:49.883 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The PWD Roadway Repair Contractor is working on your street performing patch paving.    It is an important city service for your neighborhood to provide the best permanent repairs of previous utility excavations or potholes.     The construction process is to dig out 6.5 inches of material and place 5 inches of dense binder hot mix asphalt in 2 lifts. The dense binder gives the patch its strength but is has large stones and is not conducive to providing a smooth ride  the contractor usually within a week comes back and places 1.5 inches of  the top course. The top course is hot mix asphalt  that provides the smooth ride.    The street is leafleted before the work begins where it explains that it is a mufti phase construction operation and you should look at the dates since they will change as each construction phases progresses.     Our goal is to allow parking between phases and not post the street for the entire time the work takes place. This is why the contractor repeatedly changes the dates.     We spoke to the contractor about his need to be totally accurate when posting and leafletting  for upcoming work.     Since this is a patching contract  the contractor may only be on your street for only a short period of time; giving the appearance of not showing up.     Sometimes poor weather  plant breakdowns  or equipment failure occurs which results in the delay of the upcoming work.     The CIU spoke to the contractor about his need to do a better job on changing the dates when those situations arise.     Any questions you call the City Engineer Tom Mougamian. 617-304-7308     The city apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.

Closed date : 2015-09-14 09:30:30.92 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The City acknowledges there has been a tremendous amount of construction taking place this year.    The City needs to maintain its streets and sidewalks and is working everyday to make that happen.    In addition utilities and private contractors are installing new mains/conduits  performing service connection work  maintenance upkeep  or emergency repairs.    We also have new buildings being built or existing buildings being refurbished  across the City.    The amount of construction is a sign of how vibrant the City of Boston is..    The Transportation Department takes into account traffic impact  when issuing a permit.    They take very seriously the need for construction to move as fast as possible considering the work being done.    All contractors are required to call for police details which greatly assist in the flow of traffic.    However with all the reasons stated above there may be from time to time a delay in getting around the City.     We appreciate your patience.     For any questions or concerns  please contact the number listed below    Sincerely     Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works,PublicWorks: Complaint,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,PWDx_Contractor Complaints,PWDx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"

Closed date : 2015-09-15 10:34:15.737 Case Noted While this was an anonymous complaint �we want to explain that�the hours at the BCYF Curley Community Center were not meeting the needs of working professionals due to the fact the center did not open until�8:00 a.m. People who started work at�9 a.m.�did not have sufficient time to use the facility before work  which was causing a large amount of residents to have to find other fitness facilities. After reviewing how many people use the center on average between�7:30 p.m.�and�closing (16) we decided to open at�6:30 a.m. in hopes of serving the pre-work workout crowd.�In order to accommodate the earlier opening we had to change staff schedules and this did not allow us to keep the facility open as late as we have in the past.   We do realize the inconvenience this may have caused member so we have extended the proposed closing to�8:30 p.m. This is still an earlier closing than in the past but will allow us to serve more members in the morning.� Sandy     Sandy Holden Public Information Manager Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF),Other: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,INFO_General Comments Complaints Compliments,INFO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"

Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF) operates the BCYF Curley and we have been asked to follow up on your concerns.�   The hours at the BCYF Curley Community Center were not meeting the needs of working professionals due to the fact the center did not open until�8:00 a.m. People who started work at�9 a.m.�did not have sufficient time to use the facility before work  which was causing a large amount of residents to have to find other fitness facilities. After reviewing how many people use the center on average between�7:30 p.m.�and�closing (16) we decided to open at�6:30 a.m. in hopes of serving the pre-work workout crowd.�In order to accommodate the earlier opening we had to change staff schedules and this did not allow us to keep the facility open as late as we have in the past.   We do realize the inconvenience this may have caused you so we have extended the proposed closing to�8:30 p.m. This is still an earlier closing than in the past but will allow us to serve more members in the morning.�   Sandy   Sandy Holden Public Information Manager Boston Centers for Youth & Families (BCYF) 1483 Tremont Street Boston  MA �02120,Other: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,INFO_General Comments Complaints Compliments,INFO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"

The Boston Parks and Recreation Department has legally challenged on multiple occasions dating back to the 1990s.  The courts have allowed the event to continue despite our concerns over illicit drug use  damage to park property  and amplified music.  We must respect these court decisions and the First Amendment rights of the participants.   For those who have suggested that the event be moved to another park location  please note that the organizers specifically request that the event be held on Boston Common and we have no say in that part of their application.   We will continue to work with the City of Boston Law Department to discuss our options moving forward.  Your support and input is invaluable to this process.  We are currently collecting written comments that we will present as discussions of this matter move forward.   Please understand that we are constrained by past legal decisions interpreting this as an event protected by free speech but we will continue to work to mitigate impacts on the Common and the community as best we can.

Closed date : 2015-11-09 15:31:20.84 Case Noted The City of Boston has partnered with Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare to bring 80 new car-share vehicles to Boston through the DriveBoston program. Planners from the Transportation Department visited a range of locations and selected places with the largest benefit for residents that had the smallest impact on street operations and parking. The program will place vehicles in dedicated spaces around the City  including many that are currently underserved by car-share options. The majority of the spaces will be in City-owned municipal parking lots (49 spaces)  with the remaining 31 spots being placed on street corners. The location of spaces were chosen by examining car registrations per household  average household mileage per day  the proximity to MBTA stations as well as Hubway stations  Main Street districts and coordination with Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare. Roxbury received 12 spots and Dorchester received 10 spots. Jamaica Plain received eight spots and the additional spots were distributed in small numbers across the City. The program spaces are all visible on an online map at boston.gov/driveboston.     The DriveBoston program has three main goals: (1) create ""mobility hubs"" at key MBTA stations and along bus routes to strengthen the City's transportation network; (2) reduce the number of private vehicles per household which should relieve parking pressure; and (3) better connect the Main Street Business Districts. Data collected about how frequently people use the vehicles and for what purposes will help inform the City's transportation planners on the success of the program.    National studies on the impact of car-share programs have shown significant  positive impacts.  Expanding car-share in a city  for example  can help reduce local greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover  increasing car-share availability has been shown to reduce local car ownership  as residents chose to join a car-share program rather than buy  maintain and find parking for one. One study estimates that adding each car-share vehicles reduces between nine and 13 cars overall.      The DriveBoston program is an early action initiative of Go Boston 2030  the City's transportation planning effort. The effort is being led by the Boston Transportation Department and the Mayor's Mobility Plan Advisory Committee. One of the primary goals that emerged from the GoBoston2030 planning process so far  which involved over 6 000 people  was to provide better access to all modes of travel. This call for access to all kinds of ways to get around the city has led to an aspirational target of having every Boston household within a 10 minute walk of a rail station or key bus route  a Hubway station  and car-share.    During this 18 month pilot program  The City of Boston will work with Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare to collect data on usage and survey information from members. The City will analyze the data and use it to inform constituents on the future of the program.",BTDT: Complaint,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,BTDT_General Comments,BTDT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"

Closed date : 2016-01-06 14:09:56.18 Case Noted ""Thank you for your interest in ""Drive Boston.""    As you may know  owning a car is an expensive proposition and one that is out of reach for some people.  By locating vehicles in neighborhoods that have not previously been served by traditional car share programs  Drive Boston provides residents with easy access to motor vehicles on those occasions when traveling by car would come in handy.    At the same time  on-street parking in the City can be difficult as a result of too many vehicles competing for parking at a limited amount of curb-space.  The Drive Boston program will free up parking spaces on Boston's streets by encouraging residents to make the decision to share a car rather than purchase their own.   Each individual who makes this decision will also be helping to improve the environment by decreasing overall emissions from motor vehicles.    Mayor Walsh is supportive of the Boston Transportation Department's efforts to implement Drive Boston and other initiatives designed to improve travel conditions on Boston's local streets for drivers  cyclists and pedestrians  alleviate the parking crunch  and provide equity to transportation for all City residents.    I hope that this answers your questions.

Closed date : 2016-01-06 12:09:26.697 Case Noted ""Thank you for your interest in ""Drive Boston.""    As you may know  owning a car is an expensive proposition and one that is out of reach for some people.  By locating vehicles in neighborhoods that have not previously been served by traditional car share programs  Drive Boston provides residents with easy access to motor vehicles on those occasions when traveling by car would come in handy.    At the same time  on-street parking in the City can be difficult as a result of too many vehicles competing for parking at a limited amount of curb-space.  The Drive Boston program will free up parking spaces on Boston's streets by encouraging residents to make the decision to share a car rather than purchase their own.   Each individual who makes this decision will also be helping to improve the environment by decreasing overall emissions from motor vehicles.    Mayor Walsh is supportive of the Boston Transportation Department's efforts to implement Drive Boston and other initiatives designed to improve travel conditions on Boston's local streets for drivers  cyclists and pedestrians  alleviate the parking crunch  and provide equity to transportation for all City residents.    I hope that this answers your questions.

Closed date : 2016-01-06 12:55:08.717 Case Noted The City of Boston apologizes for the inconvenience you have with the meters  we are working to improve the customer experience for all users and appreciate your feedback. We are currently transitioning to meters that will allow you to use coins  but also a credit card. The meter card technology has become outdated and will become increasingly difficult to maintain. Therefore  the City is taking steps to provide multiple ways to pay while still being smart about maintaining our meter inventory. Meter cards will continue to be accepted until the City transitions to the new meters.,BTDT: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,BTDT_General Comments,BTDT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call,"(0, 0)"
