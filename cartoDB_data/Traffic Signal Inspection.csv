Closed date : 2015-10-09 12:07:08.703 Case Noted Each crosswalk's flashing Don't Walk across State St is timed for that particular crosswalk's length versus the longest crosswalk in the intersection. The east crosswalk crossing State St is on during the Congress St green phase  and during the all-walk phase  versus the west crosswalk crossing State St that is only on during the exclusive pedestrian phase.  Late at night  the exclusive pedestrian phase can be skipped - so the west crosswalk must be timed independently for it's own length in case the light goes from Congress St to State St  skipping the exclusive pedestrian phase.,Traffic Signal Inspection,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Inspection,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/55d226e004858b6818a11d75/report.jpg,,INTERSECTION of Congress St & State St  Boston  MA,3.0,1C,1.0,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3.0,Ward 3,306.0,,INTERSECTION Congress St & State St,,Intersection,3431.0,42.3589,-71.0568,Citizens Connect App,"(42.3589, -71.0568)"

Closed date : 2015-11-02 09:01:51.25 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works  Department is currently reconstructing Staniford and Causeway Streets.     In addition we are allowing some utility work to be done before the final paving is scheduled.     When completed it will be a major improvement for  the pedestrians  cyclists and motorists who travel these street daily.    We acknowledge the construction is a major inconvenience to the public.      We have police details called in every day. They obviously will help with traffic control and public safety.    You will also notice more jersey barriers and barricades in use to help guide pedestrians and traffic through and around the work zones.     We have asked the contractor to restore all pavement markings within their work zone even if they have not disturbed the markings. This means that all crosswalks/ double yellows/skip lines/ arrow onlys etc will be maintained throughout the project.    All temporary pavement markings will be completed by November 6th    We ask for your patience while this major project takes place.     For any questions or concerns  please contact the project engineer Kay Barned-Smith at 617-635-4951     Sincerely      Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works Department   617-635-4951,Traffic Signal Inspection,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Inspection,PWDx_Contractor Complaints,PWDx,https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/5625353d0485a31f9a2691f7/report.jpg,,INTERSECTION of Longfellow Pl & Staniford St  Boston  MA,3.0,1B,8.0,A1,Back Bay,3.0,Ward 3,305.0,,INTERSECTION Longfellow Pl & Staniford St,,Intersection,6226.0,42.3638,-71.0635,Citizens Connect App,"(42.3638, -71.0635)"

The purpose of this interim project is to provide safety improvements for vehicles  pedestrians  and bicycles.   �   As part of the project  the intersections will be reconstructed to provide increased capacity and improve intersection operations for all modes.� All new traffic signal equipment will be installed with modification to the phasings and timings.� ADA compliant ramps will be provided at the 2 intersections as well as pedestrian indications.   �   In addition to the improvements at these locations  a new traffic signal controller and cabinet will be provided at River Street/Memorial Drive in order to maintain compatibility and communication with the intersections on the Boston side of the Charles River.   �   I hope this helps!� Further questions should be directed to MassDOT�s Rob Antico  the project manager at:�     �  Robert.Antico@state.ma.us,Traffic Signal Inspection,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Inspection,INFO01_GenericeFormforOtherServiceRequestTypes,INFO,https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov/media/boston/report/photos/563b58b055a527e2b915b315/photo_20151105_082218.jpg,,INTERSECTION of Cambridge St & Soldiers Field Rd  Allston  MA,11.0,04,9.0,D14,Allston / Brighton,15.0,Ward 22,2201,,INTERSECTION Cambridge St & Soldiers Field Rd,,Intersection,2359.0,42.3609,-71.1177,Citizens Connect App,"(42.3609, -71.1177)"

Under this system it is possible to provide longer ""Walk"" times and shorter delays to vehicles and pedestrians.  During the green light for vehicles ""Walk"" signals are on for pedestrians crossing parallel to the flow of traffic.  Under this system turning traffic must yield to pedestrians.

Closed date : 2015-11-30 12:06:57.073 Case Noted Thank you for contacting BTD regarding the traffic signal at Atlantic & Seaport.      BTD implemented a new traffic sequence in August after an extensive study to improve operations for vehicles on Atlantic Avenue  Seaport Boulevard  and Oliver Street  as well as for pedestrians crossing the intersection.      Prior to the change  pedestrians were only given a walk signal to cross Seaport Boulevard during an exclusive walk phase.  However  BTD observations revealed many pedestrians crossed Seaport Boulevard against the Don't Walk signal while AtlanticAvenue had a green light  which is a consequence of exclusive walk phases as they can create excessive pedestrian delay.    In order to improve overall operations  the exclusive walk phase was removed and replaced with concurrent walks (pedestrians cross in the same direction as traffic with a green light).  There is also a 6 second lead Walk for pedestrians crossing Seaport Boulevard prior to Atlantic Avenue turning green  allowing them to establish themselves in the intersection before conflicting right turns from vehicles.      This has allowed BTD to give more green time to all street approaches.  Our follow-up study has shown that traffic queues from all approaches  including Atlantic Avenue  have significantly decreased since implementation of the new signal sequence.  It is state law for turning vehicles to yield to pedestrians legally in the crosswalk.  While a concurrent walk signal crossing may have more pedestrians in the crosswalk as vehicles attempt to turn right  the added green time on Atlantic Avenue will provide gaps for vehicles to eventually make their turns.,Traffic Signal Inspection,Transportation - Traffic Division,Signs & Signals,Traffic Signal Inspection,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Atlantic Ave & Seaport Blvd  Boston  MA,6.0,1C,1.0,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3.0,Ward 3,0306,,INTERSECTION Atlantic Ave & Seaport Blvd,,Intersection,740.0,42.3547,-71.0515,Citizens Connect App,"(42.3547, -71.0515)"
