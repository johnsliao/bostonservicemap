I want to assure you we are looking at remedies to improve the operation at this intersection.    It is quite challenging due to the traffic volumes  two-way streets on both Dartmouth St and Columbus Avenue  limited geometry to allow widening for turn lanes  and pedestrian volumes as well.      We are in the process of retiming the Back Bay traffic signals and this intersection is part of the study.    Our goal is to come up with a signal phasing that will improve pedestrian safety and accommodate vehicles as well  without causing more backups in your neighborhood.    Currently  the traffic signal has concurrent walks for pedestrians (Walks in the same direction of traffic) and it also has turning arrows from Dartmouth SB to Columbus inbound as well as a right turn arrow from Columbus outbound to Dartmouth northbound.  One issue we have observed is pedestrians crossing Columbus Ave on the east side during the turning arrow phases even though the pedestrian signals display Don't Walk.  They see the traffic signal on Columbus Ave turn red and assume they can walk across  especially from south to north where they cannot see the turning arrows.    The benefit of an exclusive only pedestrian phase (all-walk  all-red for cars) is it is the absolute safest condition for pedestrians.  The downside to an exclusive is it adds delays to the overall intersection causing longer vehicular queues  longer cycle lengths (the amount of time for a signal to serve all approaches before starting over)  and even longer pedestrian delays because a pedestrian will have to wait for other phases to happen before finally receiving the exclusive all-walk.  This can lead to pedestrians becoming impatient and jaywalking  putting themselves in harms way.      Our current plan is to add an exclusive pedestrian phase.  Our study shows the north crosswalk across Dartmouth St is best to only operate under this condition due to the amount of left and right turning vehicles from Columbus Avenue to Dartmouth St NB.  This crosswalk will only turn on during the exclusive pedestrian phase and will display Don't Walk at all other times.  All other crosswalks will also be on during the exclusive pedestrian phase but will remain on during the concurrent traffic phases as well.  We will also eliminate the turn arrows on Dartmouth SB and Columbus outbound to Dartmouth NB  since our analysis shows arrows are not warranted and have a limited effect without a dedicated left-turn lane on to store traffic and there is no room to add one.      A hybrid exclusive/concurrent pedestrian operation should improve pedestrian safety but also not increase pedestrian delay too much overall.    I hope I explained our understanding of the situation and our plan that we hope to enact in Spring 2015 (some of the improvements require restriping and we must wait until after the winter).  Before then we will be making some adjustments to yellow/red times and pedestrian times to the way the signal currently operates.,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,Transportation - Traffic Division,Traffic Management & Engineering,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Columbus Ave & Yarmouth St  Boston  MA,4.0,1C,2.0,D4,South End,6.0,Ward 4,401.0,,INTERSECTION Columbus Ave & Yarmouth St,,Intersection,3299.0,42.3454,-71.0758,Constituent Call,"(42.3454, -71.0758)"

We are aware of the tragic accident that occurred between a school bus and a pedestrian and his dog.    I want to assure you we are looking at remedies to improve the operation at this intersection.    It is quite challenging due to the traffic volumes  two-way streets on both Dartmouth St and Columbus Avenue  limited geometry to allow widening for turn lanes  and pedestrian volumes as well.      We are in the process of retiming the Back Bay traffic signals and this intersection is part of the study.    Our goal is to come up with a signal phasing that will improve pedestrian safety and accommodate vehicles as well  without causing more backups in your neighborhood.    Currently  the traffic signal has concurrent walks for pedestrians (Walks in the same direction of traffic) and it also has turning arrows from Dartmouth SB to Columbus inbound as well as a right turn arrow from Columbus outbound to Dartmouth northbound.  One issue we have observed is pedestrians crossing Columbus Ave on the east side during the turning arrow phases even though the pedestrian signals display Don't Walk.  They see the traffic signal on Columbus Ave turn red and assume they can walk across  especially from south to north where they cannot see the turning arrows.    The benefit of an exclusive only pedestrian phase (all-walk  all-red for cars) is it is the absolute safest condition for pedestrians.  The downside to an exclusive is it adds delays to the overall intersection causing longer vehicular queues  longer cycle lengths (the amount of time for a signal to serve all approaches before starting over)  and even longer pedestrian delays because a pedestrian will have to wait for other phases to happen before finally receiving the exclusive all-walk.  This can lead to pedestrians becoming impatient and jaywalking  putting themselves in harms way.      Our current plan is to add an exclusive pedestrian phase.  Our study shows the north crosswalk across Dartmouth St is best to only operate under this condition due to the amount of left and right turning vehicles from Columbus Avenue to Dartmouth St NB.  This crosswalk will only turn on during the exclusive pedestrian phase and will display Don't Walk at all other times.  All other crosswalks will also be on during the exclusive pedestrian phase but will remain on during the concurrent traffic phases as well.  We will also eliminate the turn arrows on Dartmouth SB and Columbus outbound to Dartmouth NB  since our analysis shows arrows are not warranted and have a limited effect without a dedicated left-turn lane on to store traffic and there is no room to add one.      A hybrid exclusive/concurrent pedestrian operation should improve pedestrian safety but also not increase pedestrian delay too much overall.    I hope I explained our understanding of the situation and our plan that we hope to enact in Spring 2015 (some of the improvements require restriping and we must wait until after the winter).

Closed date : 2015-08-06 11:44:26.463 Case Noted The crosswalk across Seaport Boulevard used to be exclusive only.  However  BTD observed many pedestrians crossing Seaport Boulevard against the Don't Walk when Atlantic Avenue had its green light  which is a common observation with exclusive pedestrian phases that require a longer wait for a Walk signal.  To reduce pedestrian delay and to improve traffic operations  BTD re-sequenced the traffic signal phasing on Saturday  August 1st.  The crosswalk across Seaport Boulevard now has a 6 second advanced Walk signal to allow pedestrians to establish presence in the crosswalk before Atlantic Avenue turns green.  There are No Turn on Red Signs posted  as well as Yield to Pedestrians on Turns.  State law requires turning vehicles to Yield to Pedestrians in the crosswalk that have a concurrent Walk Signal.  Concurrent Walks signals in the same direction as traffic (i.e. crossing Seaport Boulevard while Atlantic Avenue has a green light) are a legal crossing operation for a traffic signal.  It should also be noted that this particular crosswalk no longer requires pushing the Walk button; it comes up automatically each cycle.,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,Transportation - Traffic Division,Traffic Management & Engineering,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Atlantic Ave & Seaport Blvd  Boston  MA,6.0,1C,1.0,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3.0,Ward 3,306.0,,INTERSECTION Atlantic Ave & Seaport Blvd,,Intersection,740.0,42.3547,-71.0515,Constituent Call,"(42.3547, -71.0515)"

Closed date : 2015-10-01 13:52:10.397 Case Noted Thank you for contacting BTD regarding the traffic signal at Atlantic & Seaport.      BTD implemented a new traffic sequence in August after an extensive study to improve operations for vehicles on Atlantic Avenue  Seaport Boulevard  and Oliver Street  as well as for pedestrians crossing the intersection.      Prior to the change  pedestrians were only given a walk signal to cross Seaport Boulevard during an exclusive walk phase.  However  BTD observations revealed many pedestrians crossed Seaport Boulevard against the Don't Walk signal while Atlantic Avenue had a green light  which is a consequence of exclusive walk phases as they can create excessive pedestrian delay.    In order to improve overall operations  the exclusive walk phase was removed and replaced with concurrent walks (pedestrians cross in the same direction as traffic with a green light).  There is also a 6 second lead Walk for pedestrians crossing Seaport Boulevard prior to Atlantic Avenue turning green  allowing them to establish themselves in the intersection before conflicting right turns from vehicles.      This has allowed BTD to give more green time to all street approaches.  Our follow-up study has shown that traffic queues from all approaches  including Atlantic Avenue  have significantly decreased since implementation of the new signal sequence.  It is state law for turning vehicles to yield to pedestrians legally in the crosswalk.  While a concurrent walk signal crossing may have more pedestrians in the crosswalk as vehicles attempt to turn right  the added green time on Atlantic Avenue will provide gaps for vehicles to eventually make their turns.,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,Transportation - Traffic Division,Traffic Management & Engineering,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Atlantic Ave & Seaport Blvd  Boston  MA,6.0,1C,1.0,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3.0,Ward 3,306.0,,INTERSECTION Atlantic Ave & Seaport Blvd,,Intersection,740.0,42.3547,-71.0515,Employee Generated,"(42.3547, -71.0515)"

Currently we have 7 seconds Walk time and 21 Seconds Flashing Don�t Walk (FDW) time. In fact we increased the FDW time from 18 seconds to 21 seconds this Summer. This is adequate time to cross. The walk time is the time during which pedestrians are allowed to enter the crosswalk. They do not have to complete the crossing during this time. The FDW is the clearance time and it does not mean stop walking; it means do not enter the crosswalk if not already in or continue walking if in the crosswalk to complete the crossing.    �  Thanks   Emil,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,Transportation - Traffic Division,Traffic Management & Engineering,Requests for Traffic Signal Studies or Reviews,INFO01_GenericeFormforOtherServiceRequestTypes,INFO,,,INTERSECTION of Columbia Rd & Dorchester Ave  Dorchester  MA,7.0,03,2.0,C11,Dorchester,5.0,Ward 7,0709,,INTERSECTION Columbia Rd & Dorchester Ave,,Intersection,3244.0,42.3206,-71.0568,Constituent Call,"(42.3206, -71.0568)"
